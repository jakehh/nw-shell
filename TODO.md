What needs to be implemented?



#### Yosemite

* ~~Transparency~~
* ~~Titlebar/Headerbar~~
* Blur effects (For Titlebar BG)
* Sidebars
* Lists
* Dropdowns
* Icons
* Inputs
* Breadcrumbs / Pagination
* Labels / Badges
* Possibly push a Bootstrap alert div into a notification in Yosemite when it is called/created?
* Progress Bars
* Media Object
* List Group

##### Sidenote: All of these will be implemented in Bootstrap, To allow a user to switch themes easily & only have to change the CSS file.
