* Dropdowns
* Icons
* Inputs
* Breadcrumbs / Pagination
* Labels / Badges
* Possibly push a Bootstrap alert div into a notification in Yosemite when it is called/created?
* Progress Bars
* Media Object

* Make all of the OS Buttons (Close, min & Max/Fullscreen) have :hover element when you hover over any of them.

#### Future Themes

* Adwaita (Gnome)
* Pantheon (elementary OS)
* Unity (Ubuntu)
* Moka (Gnome 3rd Party Theme)

<small>I'm always looking to add more themes! Feel free to make a merge request and i'll take a look at your theme.<br />
(If you don't know how to do a Merge request, Just start an issue & have a link to the github repo of your Theme)</small>

##### Sidenote: All of these will be implemented in Bootstrap, To allow a user to switch themes easily & only have to change the CSS file.
