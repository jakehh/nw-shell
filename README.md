# Node Webkit Shells

CSD Support for node webkit
(Yosemite Toolbar/Titlebar, Gnome/Pantheon CSD)

![Demo](http://i.imgur.com/Za6GHHT.png)

### NOTEs: 
* You will require [jtg-gg's Build of node-webkit w/ Transparency](https://github.com/jtg-gg/node-webkit/releases/tag/nw-v0.10.2-transparency) for the app to work properly.
* Shadows do not currently show when transparency is enabled, This may be fixed in the future.
* No linux support yet.
* These are very basic templates currently, Any help is welcomed!
